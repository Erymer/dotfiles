Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will.”

“All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.”
- J.R.R. Tolkien

“I have a rendezvous with Death
At some disputed barricade,

It may be he shall take my hand
And lead me into his dark land
And close my eyes and quench my breath

I have a rendezvous with Death

And I to my pledged word am true,
I shall not fail that rendezvous.”
- Alan Seeger

“My country lay within a vast desert.
When the sun rose into the sky, a burning wind punished my lands,
searing the world.
And when the moon climbed into the dark of night,
a frigid gale pierced our homes.
No matter when it came, the wind carried the same thing... Death.
But the winds that blew across the green fields of Hyrule brought
something other than suffering and ruin.
I coveted that wind, I suppose.”
- Zelda Wind Waker

“You can take a wolf from the forest. You can collar him, chain him.
You can starve him, beat him until he whimpers and bows down.
Yet, is that wolf a dog?
Never.
A man is only a slave when he allows his heart and mind to be conquered.
When he comes to believe that his life is no longer his own.
When he chooses to cast his eyes forever to the ground.
Like a king that chooses to press his lips to the feet of an emperor.
A king that looks to his goblet and his plate,
feasting and fattening while his people starve in their own streets.
Some might say that I should bear the guilt of regicide.
That I killed the King of the Ezomytes.
Yes, I served King Skothe his last meal, for I saw no king at that table.
I saw a dog.”
- Path of Exile

“I've seen your kind, time and time again.
Every fleeing man must be caught. Every secret must be unearthed.

But in the end, you lack the stomach.
For the agony that you'll bring upon yourself...”

The Two Headed Calf
“Tomorrow when the farm boys find this
freak of nature, they will wrap his body
in newspaper and carry him to the museum.
But tonight he is alive and in the north
field with his mother. It is a perfect
summer evening: the moon rising over
the orchard, the wind in the grass. And
as he stares into the sky, there are
twice as many stars as usual.”
- Laura Gilpin

“When the truth offends we lie and lie until 
we can no longer remember it's even

Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth...
sooner or later that debt is paid.”
